                <br>
                (i) To develop Techno-commercial skills in graduates and groom them to keep pace with global trends with multidisciplinary engineering knowledge (ii) To Develop Industry Oriented Manpower to accept the challenges of Globalization by impart knowledge & skill based Education in Collaboration with industry, Academia & Research Organization (iii) To prepare competent Engineers with the spirit of Entrepreneurship <br><br>

                Mechanical Engineering is the discipline that applies the principles of engineering, physics, and materials science for the design, analysis, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. It is the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery. It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering disciplines. The Mechanical Engineering field requires an understanding of core concepts including mechanics, kinematics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity. Mechanical engineers use these core principles along with tools like computer-aided design, and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others. Department of Mechanical Engineering is youngest Department in the college, having the blend of young, Energetic, experienced and dynamic faculties, who channelize their core competencies to develop the technical skills set of budding Mechanical graduates of this institute in collaboration with experts from industries of identified sectors where students having great career prospects and growth. Being youngest in the college we could able to develop our laboratories with latest Machineries, equipments and experimental setups which are over and above the prescribed syllabus for practical suggested by affiliating university. Laboratory and workshop layouts are industry oriented which accustom students with industrial working environment
